# Working With Docker Containers

This case study explores how to containerize a Python application using Docker.  The intent is to complete a `Dockerfile` that properly containerizes the application while allowing for persistent storage to be used (for the app's DB), providing a flexible path to the database using environment variables, and being flexible with the mapped port.

The candidate must not only complete the `Dockerfile` but also complete a Bash script that will start the container.

## Starting the Task

Prior to starting the work the database needs to be initialized.  This is done by running the following command either from the `code_start` directory or the `code_solution`:

```sh
make DB_FILE=db/storage.db
```

The reason things are setup this way is to provide for flexible "grading" of the task.  That is, while you provide a solution based on the overall question, grading will be able to easily modify the input data and parameters to ensure that the task was completed successfully, accounting for all of the constraints.

## Documentation for the Question

We are slowly transitioning away from monolithic apps and starting to containerize components/services where it makes sense.

Our storage status API seems like a good, first candidate.

In your code directory you will find a `Dockerfile` and a script, `app-start.sh`.  Some initial work has been done in each to containerize the storage status API.

You must do the following:

* In `Dockerfile`
  * Indicate that the app will use TCP/80
  * Indicate that the app requires a volume, `/app/db`
  * Indicate the app uses an environment variable, STORAGE_DB_API
* In `app-start.sh`, complete the docker run command such that
  * The `./db directory` is mounted at `/app/db` in the container
  * The value of the `DB_FILE` environment variable is passed as `STORAGE_API_DB` to the container
  * The port specified in the environment variable `APP_PORT` is mapped to the appâ€™s TCP/80

The `STORAGE_DB_API` variable must default to `./storage.db`.  When executed, the app should be accessible on port 8080, but this needs to be controllable with the `APP_PORT` environment variable.  No other elements of the `Dockerfile` or `app-start.sh` script should be modified.

Upon completion, set the appropriate value for the `APP_PORT` environment variable, set the `STORAGE_API_DB` environment variable to `/app/db/storage.db`, and run `./app-start.sh`.  You should then be able to access JSON data from the app at <http://localhost:8080/api/v1/status>.  

> Note that successfully seeing the JSON data does not guarantee the task was done correctly.

## Solution

The solution is provided in the `code_solution` directory with some comments in the `Dockerfile` and `app-start.sh` script as to what was done and why.
